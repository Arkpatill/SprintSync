## Summary of Work

### 1. Simulation & Analysis
- Conducted **structural simulations** in ANSYS, covering:
  - Directional deformation (multi-axis evaluation).
  - Equivalent stress (von-Mises) distribution mapping.
  - Factor of safety validation under load conditions.
  - Total deformation patterns in various orientations.
- Identified critical stress zones and displacement trends for design refinement.

#### Selected Simulation Outputs (Watermarked)
"""

# Add ANSYS watermarked images to README
for path in watermarked_paths[:4]:
    filename = os.path.basename(path)
    readme_content += f"![Simulation]({filename})\n"

readme_content += """

### 2. Mechanical Design & Detailing
- Created detailed CAD models for modular system components.
- Designed **telescopic and tripod structures** with integrated mounting points.
- Incorporated **magnetic alignment and conduction** features for module docking.
- Developed internal component holders using clips, grommets, and cable management sleeves.

### 3. Prototyping & Iterations
- Produced scaled and full-size physical prototypes.
- Performed design-for-assembly (DFA) checks for manufacturability.
- Integrated cable routing and internal protection elements into the structure.

#### Prototype Images (Watermarked)
