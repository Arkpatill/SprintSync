## 1. Simulation & Analysis
- Conducted **structural simulations** in ANSYS, covering:
  - Directional deformation (multi-axis evaluation)
  - Equivalent stress (von-Mises) distribution mapping
  - Factor of safety validation under load conditions
  - Total deformation patterns in various orientations
- Identified critical stress zones and displacement trends for design refinement.

## 2. Mechanical Design & Detailing
- Created detailed CAD models for modular system components.
- Designed **telescopic and tripod structures** with integrated mounting points.
- Incorporated **magnetic alignment and conduction** features for module docking.
- Developed internal component holders using clips, grommets, and cable management sleeves.

## 3. Prototyping & Iterations
- Produced scaled and full-size physical prototypes.
- Performed design-for-assembly (DFA) checks for manufacturability.
- Integrated cable routing and internal protection elements into the structure.
